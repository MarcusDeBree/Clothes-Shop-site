# Clothes Shop site
Created by - Ilya Shtoler (github - MarcusDeBree)

Date create - may 2021 years

Languages - Python (Django) + HTML, CSS, JS

Main idea - site for shoping clothes online with session and authenthication system.

This is my second python project. Here I used a wider range of frontend tools - Bootstrap, ZHGueers and others. The backend is done in Django.

Known bugs - Pagination is not possible on item pages if one of the categories does not have it. Both categories should have pagination, which worked correctly.

IMPORTANT - Do a migrations, create a superuser, add two Primary Categ(Mans, Womans), Add Model of Item. Only after that site can work!
